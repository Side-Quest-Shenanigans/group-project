## Planning  

We began the planning stage with a *Disney ideation phase*, allowing everyone to freely share their ideas. Each project idea was then discussed in detail, weighing the pros and cons. After careful consideration, we decided on the *game hub* as the best option—offering both a valuable learning experience for us as developers and a useful platform for helping others find gaming information and like-minded people.
