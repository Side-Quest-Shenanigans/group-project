# Group Project (Name to be Decided)

## Description  

This project is being developed by a group of passionate developers aiming to create a platform for gamers seeking information about various games. Whether users want to check a game's compatibility with specific PC setups, find recommendations for the best co-op games, or access details on a game's accessibility features, this platform will provide a centralised hub for all gaming-related queries.  

## Tech Stack  

- 🎨 **Frontend:** *Next.js, Tailwind CSS*  
- 🔧 **Backend:** *TypeScript*  
- 🔐 **Authentication & Database:** *Supabase*  
- ☁️ **Hosting:** *Docker & AWS*  
- 🧪 **Testing:** *Vitest, Playwright*  
- 🛠️ **Development Tools:** *Husky*  

## Key Features  

- **User Authentication** – Secure sign-up and login using Supabase Auth, allowing users to create personal profiles.  
- **Filtering System** – A robust filtering system to refine searches based on platform, genre, co-op options, and more.  
- **Game Recommendations** – Discover the best multiplayer, co-op, and couples' games based on preferences.  
- **Accessibility Information** – Detailed breakdowns of a game's accessibility features ensure inclusivity for all players.  
- **User Reviews & Feedback** – Users can leave ratings, reviews, and feedback on games, helping others make informed decisions.  
- **Commenting & Reviews** – Users can leave reviews and comments on games, sharing their thoughts with the community.  
- **Community Engagement** – Allows users to see how active the community is and join discussions.  

More features will be added as the project evolves! 🚀  

## Planning  

We began the planning stage with a *Disney ideation phase*, allowing everyone to freely share their ideas. Each project idea was then discussed in detail, weighing the pros and cons. After careful consideration, we decided on the *game hub* as the best option—offering both a valuable learning experience for us as developers and a useful platform for helping others find gaming information and like-minded people.  

We are still in the early stages of discussing different themes and finalising how the layout should look.  

## MVP 1  

- Set up YAML files for automated testing, containerising, and GitLab scanning to ensure no environment variables are mistakenly pushed.  
- Host the project with Vercel.  
- Create the homepage.  
- Fetch data from an API with accurate game information and display it in the correct format on the homepage.  
- Develop a category page with filters to organise and display games based on user preferences.  

## MVP 2  

- Implement authentication.  
- Create a personal profile page for each logged-in user.  
- Introduce customisable themes for users.  
- Set up Playwright to test user journeys and interactions.  

## Future Plans  

- Expand filtering options to include detailed system requirements, accessibility preferences, and community engagement levels.  
- Implement a recommendation engine that suggests games based on user activity and preferences.  
- Develop a forum or discussion board where users can interact, ask for advice, and share gaming experiences.  
- Introduce a "Wishlist" feature where users can save games they want to play in the future.  
- Enable game developers to add accessibility information directly to the platform.  
- Host on AWS using Docker containers.
